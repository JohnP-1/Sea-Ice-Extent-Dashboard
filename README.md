# Sea-and-Ice-Extent-Dashboard

Welcome to my dashboard showing how sea ice extent changes over time. To run the dashboard you will need to follow a few steps:
  1. Download the required libraries using the provided requirements.txt file. Assuming that you are using conda, you can create and environment using the command: ```conda create --name <env> --file <path to requirements.txt>```
  2. Run app.py in the /src folder. The first time you run this it will ask you if it can create and download the required data from https://nsidc.org/data/g02135/versions/3#anchor-data-access-tools. You need to agree to this to run the dashboard.
  3. Once running the dashboard will be available locally at the address: http://127.0.0.1:8050

I hope you enjoy!
